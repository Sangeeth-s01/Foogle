    <h2>Aloo Tikki (Potato Patties)</h2>
    <img src="Aloo Tikki (Potato Patties).jpg" alt="">
    <p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    
    3 medium potatoes, boiled and mashed
    1/2 cup green peas, boiled and mashed
    1 tablespoon ginger, grated
    1-2 green chilies, chopped
    1 teaspoon cumin powder
    1 teaspoon garam masala
    Salt to taste
    Oil for shallow frying
    Fresh coriander leaves, chopped (optional)
   <h3> Instructions:</h3>
    
    Prepare the Mixture:
    
    In a large bowl, combine mashed potatoes, mashed peas, ginger, green chilies, cumin powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well. You can add chopped coriander leaves for extra flavor.
    Shape the Tikkis:
    
    Divide the mixture into equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball and flatten it slightly to form a patty (tikki). You can make them as thick or thin as you prefer.
    Heat the Oil:
    
    In a pan, heat oil on medium heat. Make sure the oil is hot enough before frying the tikkis to prevent them from absorbing too much oil.
    Fry the Tikkis:
    
    Carefully place the tikkis in the hot oil. Fry them in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Cook until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides (about 3-4 minutes per side).
    Serve:
    
    Drain the tikkis on paper towels to remove excess oil. Serve hot with mint chutney or tamarind sauce.

    <img src="Vegetable Samosas.jpg" alt="">
   <p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    
    For the Dough:
    
    2 cups all-purpose flour
    1/4 cup oil or ghee
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    Water (as needed)
    For the Filling:
    
    2 medium potatoes, boiled and mashed
    1/2 cup green peas, boiled
    1 teaspoon cumin seeds
    1 teaspoon garam masala
    1 teaspoon chili powder
    1 teaspoon coriander powder
    Salt to taste
    Oil for frying
   <h3> Instructions:</h3>
    
    Make the Dough:
    
    In a bowl, mix flour, salt, and oil. Gradually add water and knead to form a smooth dough. Cover it with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
    Prepare the Filling:
    
    Heat a little oil in a pan, add cumin seeds, and let them splutter. Add the mashed potatoes, peas, garam masala, chili powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for a few minutes. Let it cool.
    Shape the Samosas:
    
    Divide the dough into small balls. Roll each ball into a circle and cut it in half. Take one half, form a cone, and seal the edge with water. Fill the cone with the vegetable filling and seal the top edge.
    Fry the Samosas:
    
    Heat oil in a deep pan for frying. Once hot, carefully add the samosas in batches. Fry until they turn golden brown and crispy, about 5-7 minutes.
    Serve:
    
    Drain on paper towels and serve hot with mint or tamarind chutney.
